Subject: Work around OV564x cameras blocking I2C bus.

Whenever the Ovti OV564x camera chip exits Software Power Down, i.e. bit 6
of reg 0x3008 (SYSTEM CONTROL00) is changed 1->0, for some reason the I2C
bus gets blocked. The next transfer fails, even if aimed at a different
device (on the same bus).

As a workaround issue a dummy read immediately afterwards, any following
I2C access will then be fine again.
