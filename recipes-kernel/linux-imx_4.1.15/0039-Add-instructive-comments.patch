Subject: Add instructive comments.

Help people like me, who didn't know a thing about Device Trees when we
started this project.

- We don't have LEDs, but at least show how it's done. For this purpose the
  "gpio-leds" driver gets compiled in by our defconfig. (Also an upcoming
  LEC-iMX6 variant will likely get a LED.)
- U-Boot overwrites the dummy size in the DDR3 memory node with the actual
  value, don't bother editing it.
- Comment that wdog1 needs to be explicitly disabled and that watchdog uses
  WDOG2_B output: Wdog2 was meant as TrustZone watchdog and doesn't connect
  to the System Reset Controller (SRC), but we need an external reset path
  via -->BMC-->POR to reset module and carrier devices anyway, and
  pin-muxing only left WDOG2_B unoccupied. And so far we're not interested
  in TrustZone.
